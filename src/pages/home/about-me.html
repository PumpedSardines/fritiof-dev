    <h2>A Bit About Myself:</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a web developer, spending my time diving into the mesh of humans,
      tech, and the virtual world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, I'm knee-deep in computer science studies at KTH Royal
      Institute of Technology, Stockholm. I'm solidifying my programming skills,
      turning complex ideas into neat lines of code. Keeping it broad, learning
      the ins and outs of all things programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm based in Stockholm, Sweden, always on the lookout for cool projects
      and nifty collaborations. Simply hit me up via Email or GitHub. Letâ€™s code
      and create something awesome together!
